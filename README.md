# Leaf-Classifier

There's a GUI where you can execute the code. 
This GUI allows you to train, to save or to load a neural network and it also allows to classify an image.

The images that have been used for this project can be downloaded from http://www.isy.liu.se/cvl/ImageDB/public/blad/index.html
